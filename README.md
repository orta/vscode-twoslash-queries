# vscode-twoslash-queries

A tiny (<100LOC) extension for VS Code that lets you use `// ^?` inside your editor to inline highlight types. Re-uses the existing TypeScript tooling infra in `*.ts`, `*.tsx`, `*.js`, and `*.jsx` files, simply adding inline info.

Useful for keyboard warriors or folks working on complex types and want to see how changes propagate throughout other types.

Click on the inline highlight type to copy to clipboard.

**Ensure that inlay hints are enabled in your VS Code settings.**

## Features

You write `// ^?` anywhere in a source file (with whitespace before, between and middle being whatever) all that matters is the alignment of the `^`.

You can see here it in use a few times:
